## **üìë Overview**
This is a bot for [Twitch].<br>
It's developed for private use and only extended with more functionality on demand.

It's hosted on GitHub in order to properly maintain it with version control, continuous integration and public access.

Feel free to use it yourself but don't expect much support, fast fixes and core changes.


## **üîß Installation**
1. Download the latest version from the [releases] for your OS.
2. Unzip the archive.
3. Copy and edit the `example-config.toml` to your needs and name it `config.toml`.
4. Start the executable from the root directory of the project (same directory where the license is located).


## **‚úã Usage**
This is just a chat bot.<br>
If you properly configured it, it will listen to commands posted in the respective [Twitch] channels.

Since this is a project mostly for private use, we will not go into detail here.<br>
Make use of the `help` command if you don't know what to do.

New builds are automatically compiled and released when a new version tag is pushed.<br>
There is no auto-updater but a notifier on startup when there is a new version.


## **‚è∞ Changelog**
Everything related to versions and their release notes can be found in the [changelog].


## **üéì License**
This project is licensed under the [MIT][license] license.
